The following are solutions to the problem set found at http://projecteuler.net/
IN RUBY!!!!!!!!

To run all the problems that I have completed 
-> ruby euler_solutions.rb
To run specific problems 
-> ruby euler_solutions.rb 1 2 3 4
To run all problems concurrently (slightly faster) 
Note: run times are less accurate due to scheduling of threads
-> ruby euler_solutions.rb -threaded
